# Task - 02 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Description:
In this task, I have applied the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to segment customers of a mall based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The goal is to group similar customers together to help the business understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Dataset:
The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains the following relevant features:
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1-100)**

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used:
- **K-Means Clustering**
  - An unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into clusters based on similarity.
  - The **Elbow Method** was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

---

## 📊 Output:
- Elbow Method plot to find optimal K
- Final clustered scatter plot of customers

---

## 🔎 Visualizations:

### 📍 Elbow Method:
Helps in finding the optimal number of clusters (K) by plotting Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).

### 📍 Cluster Plot:
A 2D scatter plot showing how customers are segmented into different groups based on their income and spending.

---

## 📌 Steps Involved:
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Select relevant features for clustering
3. Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
4. Apply KMeans clustering
5. Visualize the clusters
